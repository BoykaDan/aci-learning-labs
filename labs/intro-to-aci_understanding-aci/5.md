### ACI GUI Walkthrough
We have configured a Tenant named "Heroes" with an example application named "Save_The_Planet". Go ahead and browse to the apic GUI and login.

```
URL: https://apic
User: admin
Password: password
```
![APIC Login](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/apic_login.png)

Browse to the "Heroes" Tenant by:

1. Clicking on Tenants
2. Double-clicking on Heroes

![Open Heroes](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/open_heroes_tenant.png)

Expand the "Application Profiles," "Networking," and "Security Policies" directories on the left hand side; you will see several items that we discussed under Tenant Networking and Policy

##### Create Application Profile
You will create a new 2-tier application and use existing contracts to provide and consume services. In the GUI, right click on "Application Profiles" and choose "Create Application Profile."

![Create Application](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/create_application.png)

1.  Name the Application "Power_Up"
2.  Click "SUBMIT"

![Name Application](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/name_application.png)

##### Create Web EPG
Now that the Application is created, we need to configure the Web and DB EPGs that form this application. Expand the "Power_Up" directory to get access to the EPGs; right-click on "Application EPGs" and choose "Create Application EPG."

![Create EPG](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/create_epg.png)

1.  Name the EPG "Web"
2.  Choose "Heroes/Hero_Land" from the Bridge Domain drop-down (this determines what Subnets are available for hosts assigned to this EPG)
3.  Click "FINISH"

![Create Web](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/create_web.png)

In order to have the Web tier provide a contract you need to expand the Web EPG, and right-click on Contracts and select "Add Provided Contract."

![Web Provide](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/web_provide.png)

1. Choose "common/web" from the Contract drop-down menu
2. Click "SUBMIT"

![Provide Web](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/provide_web.png)

Consuming a contract follows the same steps, except choose "Add Consumed Contract" this time.

![Web Consume](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/web_consume.png)

1. Choose "common/sql" from the Contract drop-down menu
2. Click "SUBMIT"

![Consume SQL](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/consume_sql.png)

The Web EPG is created, now follow the same steps to create the DB EGP.

##### Create DB EPG
Right-click on "Application EPGs" and choose "Create Application EPG."

![Create EPG](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/create_epg.png)

1.  Name the EPG "DB"
2.  Choose "Heroes/Hero_Land" from the Bridge Domain drop-down
3.  Click "FINISH"

![Create DB](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/create_db.png)

Have the DB tier provide the "SQL" contract: expand the DB EPG, and right-click on Contracts and select "Add Provided Contract."

![DB Provide](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/db_provide.png)

1. Choose "common/sql" from the Contract drop-down menu
2. Click "SUBMIT"

![Provide SQL](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/provide_sql.png)

The DB tier does not consume any services, so the application is now complete with the Web servers able to access the DBs for SQL services.

##### Layer 3 External Contracts
You configured the Web servers to provide the "common/web" contract, but did not have any EPG consume that contract. It turns out that the L3 External Network is already consuming this contract, so the Web servers are reachable from the External Network. Go ahead and look at the Contracts for the L3 External:

1.  In the "Networking" directory, expand "External Routed Networks"
2.  Expand "Heroes_external_corporate"
3.  Expand "Networks"
4.  Click "Heroes_default"

![Browse Heroes External](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/browse_heroes_external.png)

Notice that the External Network for these contracts is the default, 0.0.0.0/0. To view the Contracts, click on the Contracts tab in the upper right-hand side of the GUI.

![Heroes External Contracts](/posts/files/intro-to-aci_understanding-aci/assets/images/heroes_external_contracts.png)

This shows the "web" contract from the "common" Tenant being consumed by 0.0.0.0/0. This means that any time an EPG provides the "common/web" contract, which we had the "Heroes/Power_Up/Web" EPG provide, the Heroes Corporate Network is able to access the Web Server.

It is extremely important to understand Tenant Networking and Tenant Policy before you start programming ACI. Since we've covered these basics, let's now move to looking at the different programability options ACI has to offer.
