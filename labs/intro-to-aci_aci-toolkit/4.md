### Using the Toolkit Library
Using the Python library will be very similar to using the Cobra library. Here is a basic workflow:

1.  Import the acitoolkit library
2.  Establish a session with the APIC
3.  Store instances of MOs (Tenant, Bridge Domain, EPG, etc.) into variables
4.  View or manipulate the MOs by using the available functions from the MOs class
5.  Submit any configuration changes to the APIC

Before using the Toolkit library, you might want to create a credentials file that can be imported instead of having to re-type login information each time. We have provided a `credentials.py` file in the code sample repo.

Make sure the file is in the directory where Python programs will be executed from, or that it is in the System Path. If you are using your own environment, the file should look like this with updated parameters:
```
URL = 'https://apic'
LOGIN = 'admin'
PASSWORD = 'password'
```

#### Tenant Example
We walk you through building a new Tenant, and then provide you with the configuration details to create another Tenant. The below diagram outlines the configuration:

*  `+` represents parent/child relationships
*  `.` represents attributes of an object
*  `()` lists the necessary parameters

```
Tenant(name)
|
+-- VRF(name, parent)
|
+-- Bridge Domain(name, parent)
|   |
|   .add vrf(vrf)
|   |
|   +-- Subnet(name, parent)
|       |
|       .set gateway(ip address/subnet mask)
|       |
|       .set scope(scope)
|
+-- Filter(name, parent)
|   |
|   +-- Filter Entry(name, parent, ethertype, protocol, starting destination port, ending destination port)
|
+-- Filter(name, parent)
|   |
|   +-- Filter Entry(name, parent, ethertype, protocol, starting destination port, ending destination port)
|
+-- Contract(name, parent)
|   |
|   +-- Contract Subject(name, parent)
|       |
|       .add filter(filter)
|
+-- Contract(name, parent)
|   |
|   +-- Contract Subject(name, parent)
|       |
|       .add filter(filter)
|
+-- Application Profile(name, parent)
    |
    +-- EPG(name, parent)
    |   |
    |   .add bridge domain(bridge domain)
    |   |
    |   .provide contract(contract)
    |   |
    |   .consume contract(contract)
    |
    +-- EPG(name, parent)
        |
        .add bridge domain(bridge domain)
        |
        .provide contract(contract)
```

A brief explanation is provided before each step to clarify the code's purpose; the code blocks contain the Python code. Open a Python Interpreter session and follow along.
```bash
$ python
>>> 
```

##### Import Libraries
The credentials file is imported for APIC login, and acitoolkit for configuration.
```python
>>> from credentials import *
>>> from acitoolkit.acitoolkit import *
>>> 
```

##### Create a Session with the APIC
The `Session class` and `login function` are used to establish a connection with the APIC. You should see a "200" indicating you succussfully logged into the APIC. URL, LOGIN, and PASSWORD come from importing credentials.
```python
>>> session = Session(URL, LOGIN, PASSWORD)
>>> session.login()
<Response [200]>
>>> 
```

##### Create a Tenant with a VRF
A Tenant is a top level object, so whether creating a new Tenant or modifying an existing Tenant's children, this should be the first object defined. A new Tenant is created by passing the Tenant's name (string format) into the `Tenant class`.

When creating a new Tenant, it should also be tied to a VRF. A VRF is created and associated to a Tenant by passing the VRF's name (string format) and tenant object into the `Context class`.
```python
>>> tenant = Tenant("Example_Tenant")
>>> vrf = Context("Example_VRF", tenant)
>>> 
```

##### Create a Bridge Domain Associated with the Tenant and VRF
The next thing to configure for the new Tenant is a Bridge Domain. A Bridge Domain is also a child of the Tenant object, and has a relationship with 1 VRF, 1 or more Subnets, and 1 or more EPGs. A Bridge Domain is created and associated to a Tenant by passing the Bridge Domain's name (string format) and tenant object into the `BridgeDomain class`

The Bridge Domain is assigned to a VRF by calling the `add_context function` on the Bridge Domain object and having the VRF object as the argument.
```python
>>> bridge_domain = BridgeDomain("Example_BD", tenant)
>>> bridge_domain.add_context(vrf)
>>> 
```

##### Add a Public Subnet to the Bridge Domain
Now that you have a Bridge Domain created, assign a Subnet to it. A Subnet is created and associated to a Bridge Domain by passing the Subnet's name (string format) and Bridge Domain object into the `Subnet class`.

The Subnet is set to be advertised to networks beyond the ACI fabric by calling the `set_scope function` on the Subnet object and passing the string "public" as the argument.

You can assign a subnet and gateway IP by calling the `set_addr function` on the Subnet object and passing in the gateway and subnet mask (string format).
```python
>>> subnet = Subnet("Example_Subnet", bridge_domain)
>>> subnet.set_scope("public")
>>> subnet.set_addr("10.10.10.1/24")
>>> 
```

##### Create an HTTP Filter Associated with the Tenant
It is important to create the Filter objects next since Contracts will form a relationship with a Filter. Filters are child objects of a Tenant, and have a relationship with 1 or more Filter Entries and 1 or more Contract Subjects. A Filter is created and associated to a Tenant by passing the Filter's name (string format) and Tenant object into the `Filter class`.

Since we are creating two Filters, we must use more unique variable names to distinguish between the them.
```python
>>> filter_http = Filter("http", tenant)
>>> 
```

##### Add an HTTP Filter Entry to the HTTP Filter
Filters are not very useful without a Filter Entry. Filter Entries define the protocols and port numbers that the parent Filter object will supply. They have several optional arguments; the most common arguments passed are ethertype, protocol, and the destination port range. Filter Entries are created and associated to a Filter by passing its name (string format), Filter object, and any optional arguments (argument= and the value in string format) into the `FilterEntry class`.
```python
>>> filter_entry_tcp80 = FilterEntry("tcp-80", filter_http, etherT="ip", prot="tcp", dFromPort="http", dToPort="http")
>>> 
```

##### Create another Filter and Filter Entry for SQL
We are creating a two-tier application with Web and Database Servers, so we need to create another Filter for our Database Tier. Repeat the steps above, but with new variable names.
```python
>>> filter_sql = Filter("sql", tenant)
>>> filter_entry_tcp1433 = FilterEntry("tcp-1433", filter_sql, etherT="ip", prot="tcp", dFromPort="1433", dToPort="1433")
>>> 
```

##### Create a Web Contract Associated with the Tenant
Contracts are also children of a Tenant object, and have a relationship with 1 or more Contract Subjects and 2 or more EPGs. Since EPGs form relationships with Contracts, it is important that Contract objects are created before building an Application Profile. Contracts are created by passing its name (string format) and Tenant object into the `Contract class`.
```python
>>> contract_web = Contract("web", tenant)
>>> 
```

##### Add an HTTP Contract Subject with a Filter to the Contract
In order for Contracts to permit communication between EPGs, they need to be associated with a Filter; this is done by creating a child Contract Subject that contains the appropriate Filter objects. Contract Subjects have a relationship with 1 or more Filters. They are created by passing the Contract Subject name (string format) and Contract object to the `ContractSubject class`.

Filters are added by calling the `add_filter` function on the Contract Subject object, and passing in the Filter object.
```python
>>> contract_subject_http = ContractSubject("http", contract_web)
>>> contract_subject_http.add_filter(filter_http)
>>> 
```

##### Create another Contract and Contract Subject for SQL
In order to create a Contract for the Database servers, the above steps needed to be repeated with new variable names.
```python
>>> contract_database = Contract("database", tenant)
>>> contract_subject_sql = ContractSubject("sql", contract_database)
>>> contract_subject_sql.add_filter(filter_sql)
>>> 
```

##### Create an Application Profile Associated with the Tenant
The Application Profile is the last child of our Tenant object. App Profiles are the parent object for 1 or more EPGs. They are created by passing the App Profile name (string format) and Tenant object to the `AppProfile class`.
```python
>>> app_profile = AppProfile("Example_App", tenant)
>>> 
```

##### Add a Web EPG to the App Profile and Associate a Bridge Domain and Contracts
EPGs provide network connectivity to hosts, and are children of an Application Profile. They also have a relationship with 1 Bridge Domain, 1 or more Domains (physical or virtual), 1 or more Static Bindings (physical connection with L2 encapsulation assignment), and 1 or more Contracts. An EPG is created by passing its name (string format) with the Application Profile object into the `EPG class`.

EPGs are associated with a Bridge Domain by calling the `add_bd` function on the EPG, and passing in the Bridge Domain object.

The EPG/Contract relationship can be either a "provide" or "consume" relationship. EPGs provide a Contract by calling the `provide` function on the EPG and passing in the Contract object. Similarly, EPGs consume a Contract by calling the `consume` function on the EPG and passing in the Contract object.
```python
>>> epg_web = EPG("Web", app_profile)
>>> epg_web.add_bd(bridge_domain)
>>> epg_web.provide(contract_web)
True
>>> epg_web.consume(contract_database)
True
>>> 
```

##### Create another EPG for Databases
Create the database EPG by following the same steps from above with new variable names. Also, the EPG/Contract relationships have been modified so that the Databases only provide the database contract. This will allow the web EPG to communicate with the database EPG over SQL.
```python
>>> epg_database = EPG("Database", app_profile)
>>> epg_database.add_bd(bridge_domain)
>>> epg_database.provide(contract_database)
True
>>> 
```

##### Configuration Not Commited
You have successfully built the new Example Tenant, but the configuration is not actually committed to the APIC yet. We can demonstrate this by retrieving a list of Tenant objects, and printing back their names to the Interpeter. ACI Toolkit has a `get` function that is called on a class to retrieve instances of that class. This function always requires a Session object, but has other required and optional arguments depending on the class.

In Python, we can use a `for loop` to iterate through the list of retrived objects and print back their names. Go ahead and verify the current Tenants:
```python
>>> tenant_list = Tenant.get(session)
>>> tenant_list
[<acitoolkit.acitoolkit.Tenant object at 0x7fe0ef8bda50>, <acitoolkit.acitoolkit.Tenant object at 0x7fe0eedfe510>,

<acitoolkit.acitoolkit.Tenant object at 0x7fe0eedfe3d0>, <acitoolkit.acitoolkit.Tenant object at 0x7fe0eedfe590>]
>>> 
>>> for tn in tenant_list:
...     print(tn.name)
... 
common
infra
mgmt
Heroes
>>> 
```

##### Confirm Configuration and commit to the APIC
An object's URL and JSON configuration can be retrieved using the `get_url` and `get_json functions` respctively. These functions can be used to print your proposed configuration changes and also to submit the configuration changes. It is always a good idea to check the configuration being submitted before actually commiting it. 

If you would like to have a more readable format, then using the `json` module allows us to manipulate how the python interpreter writes back to the terminal. Another option would be to copy the data to a text editor that can display the JSON to a more readable format.

If the configuration is correct, then you can call the `push_to_apic function` on the Session object. Since the Tenant object is the top level object for all of the configurations, you can pass the `get_url and get_json functions` on the Tenant object as URL and Data arguments. If all of the configuration changes are valid, then the change will be commited to the APIC.
```python
>>> print("\n{}\n\n{}".format(tenant.get_url(), tenant.get_json()))

                    }
                  }
                ]
              }
            }

>>> resp = session.push_to_apic(tenant.get_url(), data=tenant.get_json())
>>> 
```

##### Print Back the Results
Since acitoolkit is using the popular `requests` module, there are several options to print back the results of the configuration push. Below is an example that tests for truthiness and either prints a successful message, or an error message.
```python
>>> if resp.ok:
>>>      print("\n{}: {}\n\n{} is ready for use".format(resp.status_code, resp.reason, tenant.name))
>>> else:
>>>      print("\n{}: {}\n\n{} was not created!\n\n Error: {}".format(resp.status_code, resp.reason, subnet.name, resp.content))
...      

200: OK

Example_Tenant is ready for use
>>> 
$ 
```

##### Validating Configuration Items
Before you commited the new configuration, we had you validate the current list of Tenants on the APIC. Now that you have successfully added "Example_Tenant" to the APIC, re-check the list.
```python
>>> new_tenant_list = Tenant.get(session)
>>> for tn in new_tenant_list:
...     print(tn.name)
... 
common
infra
Heroes
mgmt
Example_Tenant
```

Now that the new Tenant is listed, check that the Application and EPGs are listed under it.

Using `get` on the AppProfile class requires an additional argument of a Tenant object. This limits the list of returned Application Profiles to only the ones contained within that particular Tenant.
```python
>>> app_list = AppProfile.get(session, tenant)
>>> for app in app_list:
...     print(app.name)
... 
Example_App
>>> 
```

Using `get` on the EPG class allows for two optional arguments: an AppProfile object and a Tenant object. In order to filter the list of returned EPGs, both of these arguments must be passed into the function call.
```python
>>> epg_list = EPG.get(session, app_profile, tenant)
>>> for epg in epg_list:
...     print(epg.name)
... 
Database
Web
>>> 
>>> exit()
$ 
```

> The complete python code is also available in the sample code repo.

Now that the ACI Toolkit has been introduced, we will have you configure a new Tenant with new child objects. Once that is configured, you will use the Lint application to veiw potential configuration errors, and the Diagram application to view the Tenant relationships.
