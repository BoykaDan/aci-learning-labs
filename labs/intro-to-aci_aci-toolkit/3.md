### Using Sample Scripts
Using the pre-built scripts that come with ACI Toolkit is an easy way to get familiar with its capabliites. This lab will have you run a few "show command" scripts to get you familiar with what is available. Before you begin, here are a few arguments that you should be aware of:

*  `-h` will display the help menu with all acceptable arguments/parameters.
*  `-u` is for passing in the URL
*  `-l` passes in the username
*  `-p` passes in the password

The login arguments can also be left out and the script will prompt for the information.

#### Browse to the acitoolkit samples directory
In order to run a few pre-defined sample scripts, you will need to be in the acitoolkit/samples directory. Most of these can be ran by simply by typing `python name-of-file.py` and entering the APIC login information.

If you are no longer in the samples directory, then go ahead and reopen it:
```bash
$ cd directory/path/to/acitoolkit/samples
$ pwd
/home/user/acitoolkit/acitoolkit/samples
$ 
```

##### Run the Show Contracts sample script
The Show Contracts script displays the name of each contract that has been created and what Tenant the contract was created under.
```bash
$ python aci-show-contracts.py
APIC login username: admin
APIC URL: https://apic
APIC Password: 
Tenant              Contract            
------              --------            
common              default             
common              web                 
common              power_up            
common              sql 
```

##### Run the Show EPGs sample script
The Show EPGs script displays the Tenant and App Profile for each EPG created in the ACI fabric.
```bash
$ python aci-show-epgs.py
APIC login username: admin
APIC URL: https://apic
APIC Password: 
TENANT              APP_PROFILE          EPG            
------              -----------          ---            
infra               access               default        
Heroes              Save_The_Planet      app            
Heroes              Save_The_Planet      web            
Heroes              Save_The_Planet      db   
```

##### Run the Show IP Endpoints sample script
The Show IP Endpoints script displays the endpoints connected to the ACI fabric providing their MAC and IP Addresses, and what Tenant, Application, and EPG they reside.
```bash
$ python aci-show-ip-endpoints.py -l admin -u https://apic -p password
MACADDRESS          IPADDRESS         TENANT          APP PROFILE     EPG             
-----------------   ---------------   -------------   -------------   -------------

44:CD:BB:C0:00:00   2222::65:3        Heroes          Save_The_Planet db              
43:CD:BB:C0:00:00   2222::65:2        Heroes          Save_The_Planet db              
44:CD:BB:C0:00:00   10.193.102.2      Heroes          Save_The_Planet web

43:CD:BB:C0:00:00   2222::66:1        Heroes          Save_The_Planet web             
44:CD:BB:C0:00:00   10.193.102.2      Heroes          Save_The_Planet db              
44:CD:BB:C0:00:00   2222::66:2        Heroes          Save_The_Planet db              
43:CD:BB:C0:00:00   10.193.102.1      Heroes          Save_The_Planet db              
43:CD:BB:C0:00:00   2222::66:1        Heroes          Save_The_Planet db      
```

##### Run the Show Endpoints sample script
The Show Endpoints script is similar to the above script, but adds what interface the endpoint is being learned on.
```bash
$ python aci-show-endpoints.py -l admin -u https://apic -p password
MACADDRESS         IPADDRESS     INTERFACE     ENCAP     TENANT    APP PROFILE      EPG

43:CD:BB:C0:00:00  2222::66:1    Heroes_FI-2B  vlan-202  Heroes    Save_The_Planet  db
44:CD:BB:C0:00:00  10.193.102.2  Heroes_FI-2B  vlan-202  Heroes    Save_The_Planet  db
43:CD:BB:C0:00:00  2222::66:1    Heroes_FI-2B  vlan-200  Heroes    Save_The_Planet  web
44:CD:BB:C0:00:00  10.193.102.2  Heroes_FI-2A  vlan-200  Heroes    Save_The_Planet  web
```

##### Run the aci-show-interface-stats sample script
The Show Interface Stats script gives a summary of interface stats. The --nonzero argument is used to limit the output to only interfaces that have been in use since the last time the counters were cleared.
```bash
$ python aci-show-interface-stats.py --nonzero
APIC login username: admin
APIC URL: https://apic
APIC Password: 
Granularity: 5min Epoch:0
   INTERFACE      TOT RX PACKETS TOT TX PACKETS RX PKTs/Sec      TX PKTs/Sec      RX BYTES/Sec     TX BYTES/Sec

These sample scripts are just pre-built programs using the ACI Toolkit library. Now that you have been introduced to the Toolkit, let's take a look at the python library.
